## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

This project wouldn't exist without [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy). Seriously — the foundation, the vision, the hard work that went into it made PaperFlow possible. We're deeply grateful to the folks behind Handy for building something so solid that we could take it and run with it.

Thank you.
